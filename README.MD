# The First Trans-Atlantic Sailboat

After a year-long hiatus from our original mission, OARS is excited to refocus our attention on what we originally set
out to accomplish: be the first team *in the world* to design a boat capable of autonomously crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

To this day, no team has successfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean in an autonomous sailboat. Teams such as 
[UBC's Transatlantic Challenge](http://ubctransat.com/) team and [SCOUT Transatlantic](http://gotransat.com/) have made
it close, but the coast of Western Europe remains elusive to the robotic seafarers. The exceedingly tumultuous 
conditions of the North Atlantic are proving to be a fierce opponent, requiring some of the best engineers in the world
to unite in order to be conquered.

Our boat is controlled by a Raspberry Pi running ROS Kinetic. We actuate the sails and rudder using Robotis Dynamixel
servos (MX-64s and an AX-12, respectively). We also use an Airmar 200WX ultrasonic weather station for wind speed and
direction, heading, and position.

[Olin Aquatic Robotic Systems](https://www.olinaquabots.com/) (OARS) is a build team at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/)
in Needham, MA. We've been around in various forms since 2013, designing autonomous sailboats as well as boats for the
[AUVSI RoboBoat competition](http://www.robonation.org/competition/roboboat).
